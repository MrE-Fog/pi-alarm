## Warning: Electricity ðŸ”Œâš¡

Working with electricity can be dangerous. BUILD THIS PROJECT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Always follow proper safety precautions. Always work under the supervision of a qualified professional. T-MOBILE and other contributors are NOT RESPONSIBLE for the serious injuries and death that can occur.

### Staying Safe

Though this project *can* use with a standard power outlet to power the alarm, but that **does not** mean *you* should do it that way. For safety sake we recommend using a battery-powered LED light.

### About the Relay Switch

The alarm is powered by a 120V outlet. The relay switch opens and closes the 120V power supply.  The relay switch has 3 input controls (`+`, `-`, and `S`).  The `+` and `-` provide the power to the relay.  The `S` turns the relay on and off.  The `+` pin on the relay connects to Pi pin `4` (5V).  The `-` pin on the relay connects to Pi pin `6` (ground).  The `S` pin on the relay connects to Pi pin `12` (GPIO 18).
